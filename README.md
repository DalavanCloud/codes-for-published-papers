# Collection of codes for published papers
## Michael Krabbe Borregaar

The license of these codes is that you are free to use them in your work, but I'd request that you cite the papers (pdfs are included in the folders) if you take minor things out of the code, and contact me with a suggestion for collaboration if you wish to base more major research efforts off this code.
